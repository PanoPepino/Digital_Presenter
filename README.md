# digital_presenter

TO DO:

- Transform into a package. To think how to add the svg's within the package and the route to those .svg piece with respect to the obj_creature file rather than the example.py location one.

----------------------------------------------------

Files of python and Manim libraries created to display a digital presenter creature which writes and acts as written in a script (csv). This script has two "columns": One for the actions of the creature, while the other one is the text to be displayed.

- Note that you may have to change the position of shoulders, eyes, body, hands, depending on the new figures you add.
- The .csv file must not have an extra line in the end. It gives error. This requires to be fixed.
- The .csv file will be read and two lists will be created; one with emotions that the creature will represent and one with things to say, that will be written on the screen with Type animation (Abulafia)
- Here you can see a demo:
