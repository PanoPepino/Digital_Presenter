# digital_presenter
Files of python and Manim libraries created to display a digital presenter creature which writes and acts as written in a script (csv).

- Note that you may have to change the position of shoulders, eyes, body, hands, depending on the new figures you add.
- The .csv file must not have an extra line in the end. It gives error. This requires to be fixed.
- The .csv file will be read and two lists will be created; one with emotions that the creature will represent and one with things to say, that will be written on the screen with Type animation (Abulafia) or calling them manually.
- Here you can see a video:
