class Creature(Eyes, VMobject):
    r""" This class creates a creature. It inherites properties from VMobject and Eyes. To place the eyes, there is an anchor point called frown. To place the arms, there are anchor points called shoulders. The creature main features are: The eyes and two hands used to point to things. The hands and the body are svg objects. 
    
    It also eats parameters from the Eyes class. These are:
    
    Parameters (Attributes)
    ----------
     
    - eyelid_color_input = The color of the eye_lid. Defaults to BLACK. Observe that the body and hands will also default to this color.
    - eyeball_color = Defaults to WHITE.
    - pupil_color = Defaults to BLACK.
    - pupillary_vector = A vector that indicates the distance between the pupils of the eyes. Defaults to [1,0,0]. If 0, you get a Cyclop!
    - eye_size: Size of the eyes after separation with pupillary_vector. Defaults to 0.25.
    
    It has two main functions:
    
    Methods
    -------
    
    - pulse: Function to animate the glow (the opacity) of a piece of the body. It has a trigonometric time-dependence.
    - go_live: Similar to the blink function in the eyes class. It accounts for a time differential which increments.
